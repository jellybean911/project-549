# FAQs

`$` = terminal command

### How to get this running?

1. `$ bundle install` # install new libraries
2. `$ rails db:migrate` # updates your database with the models
3. `$ rails db:seed` # creates some fake data to get started with
3. `$ rails s -p 3000` # starts server with port 3000

### How do I reset my database?

`$ rails db:migrate:reset`

### How do I edit data in the database directly?

`$ rails console`

### How does User authentication work?

### How do all images work on our site?

https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/rails-5-2-active-storage-and-beyond

I mispoke during our meeting. Apparently Rails 5.2 introduced Active Storage! It's a quick and dirty way to store images directly in the database (or something equivalently simple). While *normally* we might avoid this, I think this is a great use-case for this method. So, yay! Images everywhere!

### What models are in are database?

1. User: name, password, and image (maybe profile pic?)
2. Activity: title, description, start_time, end_time, event_type, user, image
3. EventType: name (Activity references this)

Where can I find them? `app/models/` is where they live and where their "relationships" are defined in Rails.

eg. 

```
  has_one :event_type
  has_one_attached :image
  belongs_to :user
```

### How is our project handling Bootstrap styling?

We just pull it in in the root HTML file: `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`. It's just this simple line: `<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>`

### I don't understand how Activities works. Who owns what?

`Activity` model has this data: title, description, start_time, end_time. That's the only data *it* manages. 

`Activity` *belongs_to* a `User`. `@user.activities` should display all of the `@user's` activities that they own and `@activity.user` should give you the `User` model that owns that `@activity`. In Rails, relationships are sometimes a two-way street. You can often get object A from B and B from A. 

So what about `EventType`? Sean just created a separate field called `event_type_id` and setup a relationship between an `Activity` and an `event_type`. Each `@activity` *has_one* `event_type`. So this is a case where we can't get `@event_type.activities`. Not easily, anyways, but it's still possible with some leg work `Activity.where(:event_type_id => the_id_you_want_to_look_at)`. But we can still get the `EventType` from the `Activity` like `@activity.event_type`.

### I don't understand how the Rails architecture works. Remind me.

1. User (client) makes a request `GET /activities`
2. The browser sends the request to the server domain (in dev: localhost:3000)
3. The server gets the requests and needs to handle it. First it checks the routes for `/activities`.
4. Then, if a route exists (not 404), map the route to the controller `ActivitiesController`.
5. The request `GET /activities` has to be mapped to an `action` as well. So, the server now looks for the appropriate action (in this case `activities#index`)
6. The server deals with the `index` action: handles any `before_action` methods in the controller, does any fancy things *inside* the controller action itself, then it - by default - will try to render `app/views/activities/index.html.erb`
7. The server creates the HTML to send to the user based on the `index.html.erb` file
8. The User (client) gets the HTML, the browser parses it, and - viola - we have an application.
